<h1>UX Design and A.I.</h1>

<h2>Research Goals</h2>
<p>
	In this report, I will be looking to find how A.I. tools help UX Designers accomplish their job
	more easily. I am mostly looking to find how these tools can help facilitate the tedious parts of
	UX Design, such as organizing notes, creating empathy maps, and so on.
